Purpose:
This script simply runs a command with Inkscape to convert a file from svg to
eps, and then runs another command with pstoedit to convert it from eps to
dxf.

Requirements:
* Inkscape
* pstoedit

You will need to make sure both of these programs are accessible from the
command line, meaning you can run "inkscape --usage" or "pstoedit -help" and
get a list of command options.

On most linux distributions you should be able to use apt
or similar to install the packages, on MacOSX you may need to use something
like ports to install pstoedit then manually add the PATH options in your 
startup script (.bashrc or similar).
